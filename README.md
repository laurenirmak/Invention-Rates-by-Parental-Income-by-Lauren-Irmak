# Invention Rates by Parental Income
Investigating the relationship between parental income and rates of invention among college students in the United States.

# Why?
Invention and innovation are crucial for economic growth. Closing the invention gap caused by parental wealth would allow for 
a healthier economy which promotes productivity, efficiency, and longevity for American individuals.  

# Findings 
Using a regression analysis, I found that college students with low income parents are less likely to become
inventors. On the other hand, college students with high income parents are more likely to become inventors. 

# What can we do? 
Policy change. Incentives. Increase funding in the education sector. More resources.
