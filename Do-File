rename count_pq2 secondq

#Third quintile students variable
rename count_pq3 thirdq

#Fourth quintile students variable
rename count_pq4 fourthq

#Fifth quintile students variable
rename count_pq5 fifthq

** Rename variables that represent share of inventors conditional on parent income quintile they fall under **
#First quintile inventors variable
rename inventor_pq1 firstiq
